## HabitHeap
Gamify the grind.

As CS majors, we don't struggle with hard problems - we struggle with consistent ones. Solving a complex bug can feel easier than committing to one LeetCode question or one job application every day. Within our team, we noticed patterns among ourselves:

One teammate literally doesn't drink water unless prompted
We'd go days without practicing coding problems despite knowing interviews were coming
Job applications felt easy to push to the next day
Basic self-care (sleep, showers, going outside) became optional when deadlines loomed
We realized that extrinsic motivation (interviews, deadlines, parental expectations) wasn't working. What if we could build an app that creates intrinsic motivation within users for something they actually care about?

HabitHeap is an authentic, self-aware app built by CS majors for CS majors to make us want to do the things we know we should do.
